About the MediaGoblin Manual
============================

Welcome to the GNU MediaGoblin manual. This document targets several
classes of users, including: 

* users who would like to try the software locally, 
* systems administrators who want to deploy and administer the
  software in "production environments," and
* anyone who wants to learn how MediaGoblin works. 

Some information relevant to the MediaGoblin community members,
including how to get involved (We want and love contributors!) To join
as a contributor please see the following pages:

* http://mediagoblin.org/pages/join.html for general "join us" information
* http://wiki.mediagoblin.org/ for our contributor-focused wiki

If you suspect that documentation on http://docs.mediagoblin.org is
out of date, it might be. The documentation is updated regularly and
the "living" version of this resource resides in the ``mediagoblin``
repository with the project's source code the ``docs/`` directory. 

Improving the MediaGobiin Manual
================================

There are a few ways---please pick whichever method is convenient for
you!

1. Write up a bug report in the bug tracker at http://bugs.foocorp.net/projects/mediagoblin/issues
2. Tell someone on IRC ``#mediagoblin`` on Freenode.
3. Send an email to Will ``willg at bluesock dot org``, or Sam at
   ``sam@cyborginstitute.com``

When you tell us about your issue, please let us know:

* where you are looking (in git?  url of the web-page?)
* what the issue is, and 
* your thoughts on how to resolve it. 

We hope these materials are useful and we look forward to any and all
feedback.
